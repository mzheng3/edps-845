# Lots O' Tests

## Overview

In this activity we'll collaborate on some code for reading, manipulating, and analyzing data from a lot of tests. The data come from subsets of items administered within the PISA 2009 study, where the tests are actually test booklets. You don't need to know anything about the study. The data come from the R package equate, though we'll write and then read them as text files, for fun.

This file is located in the github repo for the course. Once you've synced your local version of the project, you'll have access to it. You should write a separate R script containing the code necessary to solve the problems below. Save your script with a file extension ".R" inside the directory edps-845/in-class/R. Your file name isn't super important, but it should attempt to convey the functionality contained within the file.

## Data

Here we'll write the data sets as csv files. Each of these 13 files contains total scores for a group of students on four subtests. Some subtests differ by test, some are used across multiple tests.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Get the R package equate
install.packages("equate")
```
```{r}
# Load equate and epmr
library("equate")
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Write 13 text files, one per test
for(i in 1:13)
  write.csv(PISA$totals[[i]], file = paste0("test", i, ".csv"))
```

Note that the equate package already contains the PISA data in R. Again, we're pretending that's not the case, at least in exercise 1 below. You will however use the other PISA data sets contained in the equate package. In equate, `PISA` is a list containing multiple data sets. As shown above, the total scores for the 13 tests are contained in `PISA$totals`.

The epmr package will also come in handy for some of the exercises below. It's not on CRAN, but you can install directly from github using the devtools package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("talbano/epmr")
```
```{r}
library("epmr")
```
## Exercises

Here are the different issues we need to address, with some tips on how you might go about writing R code to address them. The goal here is to read the data into R, prep and clean them up, analyze them, and compile results into a report.

1. Read in the 13 data files, storing each one as a data frame, with R object names `test1` through `test13`. Rather than write the code out for each test, use a loop. See the `assign()` function as a way of programmatically naming your 13 R objects.

```{r}
test1 <- read.csv("test1.csv", row.names = 1)

for(i in 1:13)
  assign(paste0("test", i), read.csv(paste0("test", i, ".csv"),
  row.names = 1))
```

2. Prep the data for analysis. Run a frequency table on every variable and summarize the results, noting any unexpected values, and the counts of missings by subtest and test. This and some of the following exercises will be a lot easier if you put all your 13 data frames into a single list. You can then use `lapply()` to iterate through it.

```{r}
test <- list(test1, test2, test3, test4, test5, test6, test7,
  test8, test9, test10, test11, test12, test13)
names(test) <- paste0("test", 1:13)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
apply(PISA$totals$b1, 1, table) # frequency for rows in test1. 
apply(PISA$totals$b1, 2, table) # frequency for columns in test1.

apply(PISA$totals$b1, 1, summary) # Summary for rows in test1
apply(PISA$totals$b1, 2, summary) # Summary for columns in test1
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(test, apply, 1, table)
#Frequency for 13 testlets, in rows.
lapply(test, apply, 2, table)
#Frequency for 13 testlets, in columns.
?apply
?lapply
lapply(test, apply, 1, summary) # summary for 13 testlets in rows.
lapply(test, apply, 2, summary) # summary for 13 testlets in columns.
```

?epmr
library(epmr)
epmr::dstudy
?dstudy

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dstudy(test1, complete = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE) #Descriptives for test1
summiss(testlets13) #missingness in 13 testlets.
#> 0
summiss(test1) # sum of missingness in test1
#> [1] 0
sumcomp(test1) #sum of complete observations in test1.
#> [1] 406
summiss(test2) # sum of missing observations in test2
sumcomp(test2) #sum of complete observations in test2.
summiss(test3) # sum of missingness in test3
#> [1] 0
sumcomp(test3) #sum of complete observations in test3.
#> [1] 409
summiss(test4) # sum of missing observations in test4
#> 2
sumcomp(test4) #sum of complete observations in test4.
#> 399
summiss(test5) # sum of missingness in test5
#> [1] 0
sumcomp(test5) #sum of complete observations in test5.
#> 402
summiss(test6) # sum of missing observations in test6
sumcomp(test6) #sum of complete observations in test6.
summiss(test7) # sum of missingness in test7
#> [1] 0
sumcomp(test7) #sum of complete observations in test7.
#> [1] 398
summiss(test8) # sum of missing observations in test8
#> 0
sumcomp(test8) #sum of complete observations in test8.
#> 402
summiss(test9) # sum of missingness in test9
#> [1] 4
sumcomp(test9) #sum of complete observations in test9.
#> 412
summiss(test10) # sum of missing observations in test10
#> 0
sumcomp(test10) #sum of complete observations in test10.
#> 406
summiss(test11) # sum of missingness in test11
#> [1] 4
sumcomp(test11) #sum of complete observations in test11.
#> [1] 406
summiss(test12) # sum of missing observations in test12
#> 0
sumcomp(test12) #sum of complete observations in test12.
#> 398
summiss(test13) # sum of missing observations in test13
#> 1
sumcomp(test13) #sum of complete observations in test13.
#> 395
```

3. Append a new column to each data set that contains the school id for the student. The row names in each test data set correspond to the row names in the PISA data set, PISA$students. This data set contains the `PISA$students$schoolid` variable. Get frequency distributions for each test so as to examine numbers of students by school by test.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The long way, not evaluated by knitr
test[["test1"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test1"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test2"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test2"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test3"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test3"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test4"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test4"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test5"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test5"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test6"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test6"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test7"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test7"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test8"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test8"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test9"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test9"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test10"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test10"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test11"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test11"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test12"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test12"]]), "schoolid"]
test[["test13"]]$schoolid <- PISA$students[rownames(test[["test13"]]), "schoolid"]
```
```{r}
# The right way
for(i in names(test))
  test[[i]]$schoolid <-
    PISA$students[rownames(test[[i]]), "schoolid"]
```

4. Find descriptives for each test and subtest by school. Collate the results into a snazzy table using either `knitr::kable()` or `xtable::xtable()`. Descriptives can be obtained with `epmr::dstudy()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Not evaluated because there's too much output

# In my list of tests, loop through the columns of each data frame,
# running descriptives by column, for each schoolid

# Let's try one data frame, one column, one schoolid
dstudy(test$test1$m1[test$test1$schoolid == 1])

# Let's now try for all school ids for a variable in a data frame
tapply(test$test1$m1, test$test1$schoolid, dstudy)

# Let's now try for all school ids for all variables in a data frame
apply(test$test1[, 1:4], 2, tapply, test$test1$schoolid, dstudy)

# Let's now try for all school ids for all variables in all data frames
# Can't be done
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# More clear to just use for loops
# Not evaluated by knitr because it's so slow
for(i in names(test)) {
  for(j in 1:4) {
    tapply(test[[i]][, j], test[[i]]$schoolid, epmr::dstudy)
  }
}
```

5. Find descriptives and internal consistency reliabilities for each subtest, by test, and collate them into another nice table. Your table should also summarize results by subject area. Reliabilities can be obtained with `epmr::rstudy()`.

```{r}
# Very similar to question 4, but instead of a tapply within your
# second loop, just use apply

# Probably easiest to get descriptives and reliabilities separately
# as they won't mix well in the same loop

# Get descriptives
out <- matrix(NA, nrow = 52, ncol = 9)
for(i in 1:13) {
  for(j in 1:4) {
    out[j + 4 * (i - 1), 1:9] <-
      unlist(dstudy(test[[i]][, j]))
  }
}

# Or just use lapply
# lapply(test, apply, 2, dstudy)
```
```{r}
# Here's how you'd get reliablity for test1$m1 using rstudy()
# You need to extract the item names for m1 from PISA$items
# Converting factor to character is key when using this as an
# indexing object
m1items <- as.character(PISA$items$itemid[PISA$items$clusterid == "m1"])
# For all students taking m1
rstudy(PISA$students[, m1items])
# For all students in booklet 1, i.e., test1, taking m1
rstudy(PISA$students[PISA$students$bookid == 1, m1items])
```

```{r}
# By test and subtest
rout <- numeric(length = nrow(out))
for(i in 1:13) {
  for(j in 1:4) {
    tempcluster <- colnames(test[[i]])[j]
    tempitems <- as.character(PISA$items$itemid[PISA$items$clusterid == tempcluster])
    rout[j + 4 * (i - 1)] <- rstudy(PISA$students[PISA$students$bookid == i, tempitems])[1, 1]
  }
}
```

```{r}
# Combine in a matrix, and print as a table
drout <- data.frame(out, rout)
colnames(drout) <- c("mean", "median", "sd", "skew", "kurt", "min",
  "max", "n", "na", "alpha")
knitr::kable(drout, digits = 2)
```

```{r}
# Rewrite this stuff replacing tapply with our own function
dstudy2 <- function(thetest) {
  out <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(levels(thetest$schoolid)), ncol = 9)
  for(j in 1:4) {
    out[j, ] <- unlist(tapply(thetest[, j], thetest$schoolid,
      epmr::dstudy))
  }
  return(out)
}

# Test it
lapply(test, dstudy2)
```

6. We know that any test administered in written form will require, to some extent, reading ability, though the test itself may not be intended to measure reading ability. We also know that science often involves some amount of math ability. Use linear models to examine the relationships between science, as a dependent variable, and math and reading, as independent variables. Note that only 6 of the 13 tests contain a math, reading, and science subtest. If a test contains more than one subtest in a subject area, choose one. Summarize results across these 6 tests.
