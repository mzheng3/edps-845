\arguments{
 \item{Data}{numeric: either the data matrix only, or the data matrix plus the vector of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{group}{numeric or character: either the vector of group membership or the column indicator (within \code{Data}) of group membership. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{focal.names}{numeric or character vector indicating the levels of \code{group} which correspond to the focal groups.}
\item{anchor}{either \code{NULL} (default) or a vector of item names (or identifiers) to specify the anchor items. See \bold{Details}.}
 \item{alpha}{numeric: significance level (default is 0.05).}
 \item{purify}{logical: should the method be used iteratively to purify the set of anchor items? (default is FALSE).}
 \item{nrIter}{numeric: the maximal number of iterations in the item purification process (default is 10).}
 \item{save.output}{logical: should the output be saved into a text file? (Default is \code{FALSE}).}
 \item{output}{character: a vector of two components. The first component is the name of the output file, the second component is either the file path or 
              \code{"default"} (default value). See \bold{Details}.}

                    \bold{Details}.}
 \item{...}{other generic parameters for the \code{plot} or the \code{print} functions.}
}

\value{
 A list of class "GMH" with the following arguments:
  \item{GMH}{the values of the generalized Mantel-Haenszel statistics.}
  \item{alpha}{the value of \code{alpha} argument.}
  \item{thr}{the threshold (cut-score) for DIF detection.}
  \item{DIFitems}{either the items which were detected as DIF items, or "No DIF item detected".}

   row refer to items which were classified respectively as non-DIF and DIF items at the (\emph{i}-1)-th step. The first row corresponds to the initial
   classification of the items. Returned only if \code{purify} is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{convergence}{logical indicating whether the iterative item purification process stopped before the maximal number \code{nrIter} of allowed iterations.

\details{
 The generalized Mantel-Haenszel statistic (Somes, 1986) can be used to detect uniform differential item functioning among multiple groups,
 without requiring an item response model approach (Penfield, 2001).
 
 The \code{Data} is a matrix whose rows correspond to the subjects and columns to the items. In addition, \code{Data} can hold the vector of group membership.
 If so, \code{group} indicates the column of \code{Data} which corresponds to the group membership, either by specifying its name or by giving the column number.
 Otherwise, \code{group} must be a vector of same length as \code{nrow(Data)}.
 
 Missing values are allowed for item responses (not for group membership) but must be coded as \code{NA} values. They are discarded from sum-score computation.

 The vector of group membership must hold at least three value, either as numeric or character. The focal groups are defined by the values of the argument
 \code{focal.names}. If there is a unique focal group, then \code{difGMH} returns the output of \code{\link{difMH}} (\bold{without} continuity correction).

 The threshold (or cut-score) for classifying items as DIF is computed as the quantile of the chi-squared distribution with lower-tail
 probability of one minus \code{alpha} and with as many degrees of freedom as the number of focal groups.
 
 Item purification can be performed by setting \code{purify} to \code{TRUE}. Purification works as follows: if at least one item detected as functioning 
 differently at the first step of the process, then the data set of the next step consists in all items that are currently anchor (DIF free) items, plus the 
 tested item (if necessary). The process stops when either two successive applications of the method yield the same classifications of the items (Clauser and Mazor,
 1998), or when \code{nrIter} iterations are run without obtaining two successive identical classifications. In the latter case a warning message is printed. 

A pre-specified set of anchor items can be provided through the \code{anchor} argument. It must be a vector of either item names (which must match exactly the column names of \code{Data} argument) or integer values (specifying the column numbers for item identification). In case anchor items are provided, they are used to compute the test score (matching criterion), including also the tested item. None of the anchor items are tested for DIF: the output separates anchor items and tested items and DIF results are returned only for the latter. Note also that item purification is not activated when anchor items are provided (even if \code{purify} is set to \code{TRUE}). By default it is \code{NULL} so that no anchor item is specified.

 The output of the \code{difGMH}, as displayed by the \code{print.GMH} function, can be stored in a text file provided that \code{save.output} is set to \code{TRUE} 
 (the default value \code{FALSE} does not execute the storage). In this case, the name of the text file must be given as a character string into the first component
 of the \code{output} argument (default name is \code{"out"}), and the path for saving the text file can be given through the second component of \code{output}. The
 default value is \code{"default"}, meaning that the file will be saved in the current working directory. Any other path can be specified as a character string: see
 the \bold{Examples} section for an illustration.

 The \code{plot.GMH} function displays the DIF statistics in a plot, with each item on the X axis. The type of point and the colour are fixed by the usual \code{pch}
 and \code{col} arguments. Option \code{number} permits to display the item numbers instead. Also, the plot can be stored in a figure file, either in PDF or JPEG
 format. Fixing \code{save.plot} to \code{TRUE} allows this process. The figure is defined through the components of \code{save.options}. The first two components
 perform similarly as those of the \code{output} argument. The third component is the figure format, with allowed values \code{"pdf"} (default) for PDF file and
 \code{"jpeg"} for JPEG file.
