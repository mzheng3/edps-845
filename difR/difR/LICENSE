      receiving party, already common knowledge;
•	which became common knowledge after it was received from the 
      disclosing party and without any fault of the receiving party;
•	which the receiving party acquired from a third party who was in
      good faith and in possession of the information and allowed to 
      disseminate the information without confidentiality obligations;
•	of which the receiving party can prove that the information was 
      developed by the receiving party independently from the knowledge 
      and skills or experiences received from the disclosing party.

      regarding the Software and regarding output as obtained from the 
      Software, provided that the above obligation of confidentiality

Annex A: Description of the Software 

difR is an R-package that allows to detect differential item 
functioning (DIF) among dichotomously scored items. It contains 
several classical methods to identify uniform or nonuniform DIF 
between two or more groups of examinees, using either a parametric 
(IRT) or a nonparametric (non-IRT) approach. 

Authors
difR was created by David Magis, Francis Tuerlinckx and Paul De Boeck 
of the Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual 
Differences of the K.U. Leuven, and by Sebastien Beland of the 
Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM). The final package was compiled 
with the help of Gilles Raiche of UQAM.
